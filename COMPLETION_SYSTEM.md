# Lesson Completion System

This document explains the new lesson and project completion system implemented in the N8n Course application.

## Features

### ‚úÖ One-Way Completion System
- **Lessons and projects can only be marked as complete, never unchecked**
- Once marked complete, the status is permanent (prevents Discord spam)
- Anti-spam protection prevents duplicate notifications

### üîî Discord Integration
- **Automatic notifications** sent to Discord when lessons/projects are completed
- **Role assignments** when modules are completed (all lessons + project done)
- **Rich embeds** with user mentions and achievement details

### üìä Real-Time Progress Tracking
- **Progress bars** update immediately when items are completed
- **Module completion** calculated dynamically (all lessons + project)
- **Dashboard overview** shows overall progress, modules, lessons, and projects completed
- **Module cards** show individual progress percentages

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Reset Tool
- **Secure reset functionality** for testing purposes
- **Password protected** with reset key: `dev-reset-2024`
- **Complete progress wipe** for the current user
- **Only visible in development** or with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_DEV_TOOLS=true`

### DeveloperReset

## Database Schema

The system uses the existing `user_progress` table:

```sql
user_progress (
  id: string (primary key)
  user_id: string (foreign key to users)
  lesson_id: string (foreign key to lessons)
  module_id: string (foreign key to modules)
  completed: boolean
  completed_at: timestamp
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
)
```

**Note:** Both lessons and projects are stored in the `lessons` table, differentiated by `order_index` (projects typically have `order_index = 4`).

## Discord Configuration

Ensure these environment variables are set:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL_ID=channel_id
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=server_id
```

## Security Features

1. **Authentication required** for all completion actions
2. **Anti-spam protection** prevents duplicate notifications
3. **Reset key protection** for developer tools
4. **Server-side validation** of all completion requests

## Real-Time Updates

The system provides immediate feedback:

1. **Optimistic UI updates** during completion
2. **Progress bars animate** to new values
3. **Completion states persist** across page refreshes
4. **Module cards update** when returning to dashboard

## Testing

Use the developer reset tool to test the completion flow:

1. Mark several lessons as complete
2. Watch progress bars update
3. Complete a project to see module completion
4. Use reset tool to clear progress
5. Repeat testing as needed

The reset key is: `dev-reset-2024`
